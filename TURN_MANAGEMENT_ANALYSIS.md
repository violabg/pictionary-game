## Current System Overview

The Pictionary game implements an **atomic turn-based system** with real-time score tracking and drawing capture. The system uses database-level atomic operations to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. It handles three main scenarios for turn completion:

1. **Atomic Correct Guess** - Player guesses correctly, atomic DB function handles everything
2. **Atomic Manual Winner** - Drawer manually selects winner, atomic DB function executes
3. **Atomic Time Up** - Timer expires, atomic DB function processes with no points

### Key Components

- **Frontend**: [`components/game/game-board.tsx`](components/game/game-board.tsx) - Main game interface with real-time subscriptions
- **Atomic Functions**: [`lib/supabase/supabase-guess-and-turns.ts`](lib/supabase/supabase-guess-and-turns.ts) - Client-side atomic operation wrappers
- **Database Functions**: [`setup.sql`](setup.sql) - Server-side atomic transaction functions
- **Player Management**: [`lib/supabase/supabase-players.ts`](lib/supabase/supabase-players.ts) - Player data operations
- **Turn Records**: [`lib/supabase/supabase-turns.ts`](lib/supabase/supabase-turns.ts) - Historical turn tracking

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Games table stores current game state
games {
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY
  current_drawer_id: UUID â†’ profiles(id)
  current_card_id: UUID â†’ cards(id)
  timer_end: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
  timer: INTEGER (default 120 seconds)
  status: TEXT ('waiting' | 'active' | 'completed')
}

-- Players table tracks scores and turn order
players {
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY
  player_id: UUID â†’ profiles(id)  -- References user profile
  game_id: UUID â†’ games(id)
  score: INTEGER (default 0)
  order_index: INTEGER
}

-- Turns table records completed rounds (enhanced)
turns {
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY
  game_id: UUID â†’ games(id)
  card_id: UUID â†’ cards(id)
  drawer_id: UUID â†’ profiles(id)
  winner_id: UUID â†’ profiles(id) (nullable)
  points_awarded: INTEGER          -- Winner points
  drawer_points_awarded: INTEGER   -- Drawer points (25% + min 10)
  turn_number: INTEGER
  drawing_image_url: TEXT
  completed_at: TIMESTAMP
}

-- Guesses table stores all player attempts
guesses {
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY
  game_id: UUID â†’ games(id)
  player_id: UUID â†’ profiles(id)  -- Direct profile reference
  guess_text: TEXT
  is_correct: BOOLEAN
}
```

### Atomic Database Functions

```sql

complete_turn_with_correct_guess(
  p_game_id UUID,
  p_guesser_id UUID,     -- Profile ID
  p_guess_text TEXT,
  p_time_remaining INTEGER,
  p_drawing_image_url TEXT
) RETURNS atomic_turn_result

-- Atomic turn completion on time up
complete_turn_time_up(
  p_game_id UUID,
  p_drawing_image_url TEXT
) RETURNS atomic_turn_result

-- Atomic turn completion with manual winner
complete_turn_manual_winner(
  p_game_id UUID,
  p_winner_id UUID,      -- Profile ID
  p_time_remaining INTEGER,
  p_drawing_image_url TEXT
) RETURNS atomic_turn_result
```

### Detailed Scenarios

#### 1. Atomic Correct Guess Flow

**Trigger**: Real-time subscription detects correct guess
**Location**: [`game-board.tsx:293-325`](components/game/game-board.tsx:293)

```typescript
// Atomic sequence of events:
1. Guesser calls submitGuess(gameId, playerId, guess, timeRemaining)
   - Validates guess against card.title
   - Inserts guess record with is_correct=true
2. Real-time subscription triggers on drawer client
3. Drawer calls handleCorrectGuess(guesser, guessText)
   - Captures drawing image via captureDrawing()
   - Calls completeCorrectGuessTurn() atomic function
4. Database atomic transaction:
   - Validates guess correctness again
   - Updates guesser score: +timeRemaining points
   - Updates drawer score: +max(10, timeRemaining/4) points
   - Creates turn record with both point amounts
   - Marks card as used
   - Selects next drawer (round-robin)
   - Gets next unused card or completes game
5. Real-time updates propagate to all clients
```

#### 2. Atomic Manual Winner Selection

**Trigger**: Drawer clicks "Seleziona Vincitore" button
**Location**: [`game-board.tsx:386-419`](components/game/game-board.tsx:386)

```typescript
// Atomic sequence of events:
1. Drawer opens SelectWinnerModal (timer pauses)
2. Drawer selects winner from eligible players
3. handleSelectWinner(winner) called
   - Captures drawing image
   - Calls completeManualWinnerTurn() atomic function
4. Database atomic transaction:
   - Validates winner is not the drawer
   - Updates winner score: +timeRemaining points
   - Updates drawer score: +max(10, timeRemaining/4) points
   - Creates turn record with manual selection
   - Advances to next turn atomically
5. Modal closes, game continues with new turn
```

#### 3. Atomic Time Up Scenario

**Trigger**: Timer countdown reaches 0
**Location**: [`game-board.tsx:133-163`](components/game/game-board.tsx:133)

```typescript
// Atomic sequence of events:
1. Timer interval detects timeRemaining <= 0
2. "Time Up" modal displayed with correct answer
3. If user is drawer: handleTimeUp() called automatically
   - Captures drawing image
   - Calls completeTimeUpTurn() atomic function
4. Database atomic transaction:
   - Creates turn record with winner_id = null
   - Awards 0 points to all players
   - Marks card as used
   - Advances to next turn
5. Game continues with new drawer/card
```

## Scoring System

### Point Calculation (Enhanced)

- **Guesser Points**: `timeRemaining` seconds as points (full time bonus)
- **Drawer Points**: `max(10, timeRemaining / 4)` points (25% + minimum 10)
- **Time Up**: `0` points for both guesser and drawer
- **Maximum Guesser Points**: Equal to timer duration (default 120)
- **Maximum Drawer Points**: Equal to timer duration / 4 (default 30)

### Atomic Score Update Process

```typescript
// Database-level atomic operations:
1. Lock game row to prevent concurrent modifications
2. Validate game state (drawer, card, etc.)
3. Calculate points for both guesser and drawer
4. Update both player scores in single transaction
5. Create turn record with both point amounts
6. Advance game state (next drawer, next card)
7. Return success with new scores
```

### Score Persistence

- **Atomic Updates**: Both guesser and drawer scores updated in single transaction
- **Historical**: Records both `points_awarded` and `drawer_points_awarded`
- **Real-time**: Updates propagate via Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Leaderboard**: Aggregates from `players.score` across all games
- **Audit Trail**: Complete turn history with point breakdown

## State Management

### Game State Variables

```typescript
interface GameState {
  currentCard: CardType | null; // Card being drawn
  isDrawer: boolean; // Current user's role
  turnStarted: boolean; // Timer active
  turnEnded: boolean; // Prevent race conditions
  timeRemaining: number; // Countdown value
  isStartingTurn: boolean; // UI loading state
}

interface ModalState {
  showSelectWinner: boolean; // Manual selection UI
  showTimeUp: boolean; // Time expired UI
  correctAnswer: string | null; // Display answer
  isTimerPaused: boolean; // Pause during selection
}
```

### Race Condition Prevention

1. **`turnEnded` Flag**: Prevents multiple next turn calls
2. **Loading States**: Prevents duplicate button clicks
3. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Handle concurrent operations
4. **Timer Pausing**: Stops countdown during manual selection

## Issues & Pain Points

### Previous Limitations (Now Resolved)

1. **âœ… Race Conditions - FIXED**

   - ~~Multiple correct guesses could trigger duplicate turn advances~~
   - **Solution**: Atomic database functions with row locking prevent concurrent modifications
   - ~~Timer and manual selection can conflict~~
   - **Solution**: Single atomic transaction handles all turn state changes

2. **âœ… Error Handling - IMPROVED**

   - ~~Limited retry logic for failed operations~~
   - **Solution**: Database-level error handling with proper rollback
   - ~~No rollback mechanism for partial failures~~
   - **Solution**: Atomic transactions ensure all-or-nothing operations
   - ~~Network issues can leave game in inconsistent state~~
   - **Solution**: Server-side validation and state consistency

3. **âœ… Scoring Issues - ENHANCED**
   - ~~Scoring only based on time remaining~~
   - **Solution**: Dual scoring system (guesser + drawer points)
   - **Enhanced**: Drawer gets 25% of time + minimum 10 points
   - **Better**: Both scores updated atomically

### Current Limitations

1. **User Experience**

   - Limited visual feedback during turn transitions
   - No progress indicators for atomic operations
   - Could benefit from better loading states

2. **Advanced Features**

   - No difficulty-based scoring multipliers
   - No streak bonuses or achievements
   - No AI-powered drawing analysis

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Real-time subscriptions could be more targeted
   - Drawing upload could be optimized
   - Caching opportunities for card data

## Improvement Suggestions

### 1. Enhanced Race Condition Handling

```typescript
// Add turn state machine
enum TurnState {
  WAITING = "waiting",
  ACTIVE = "active",
  ENDING = "ending",
  COMPLETED = "completed",
}

// Add optimistic locking
interface TurnLock {
  gameId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  lockId: string;
  expiresAt: Date;
}
```

### 2. Improved Scoring System

```typescript
interface ScoringConfig {
  basePoints: number; // Base points for correct guess
  timeBonus: number; // Multiplier for time remaining
  streakBonus: number; // Bonus for consecutive correct guesses
  difficultyMultiplier: number; // Based on card difficulty
  creativityBonus?: number; // AI-analyzed drawing quality
}

// Example: basePoints + (timeRemaining * timeBonus) + streakBonus
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Recovery

```typescript
interface TurnTransaction {
  id: string;
  gameId: string;
  operations: Array<{
    type: "UPDATE_SCORE" | "CREATE_TURN" | "UPLOAD_DRAWING";
    data: any;
    completed: boolean;
    rollback?: () => Promise<void>;
  }>;
}

// Implement transaction-like behavior for turn completion
```

### 4. Real-time Optimizations

```typescript
// Channel-based updates instead of polling
interface GameChannels {
  gameState: `game:${gameId}:state`;
  guesses: `game:${gameId}:guesses`;
  timer: `game:${gameId}:timer`;
  drawer: `game:${gameId}:drawer`;
}

// Reduce subscription overhead
```

### 5. Advanced Timer Features

```typescript
interface TimerConfig {
  duration: number;
  pausable: boolean;
  extensible: boolean;
  warningThresholds: number[]; // [30, 10, 5] seconds
  autoExtendOnCorrectGuess?: number;
}
```

### 6. Turn Analytics

```typescript
interface TurnAnalytics {
  turnId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  guessCount: number;
  averageGuessTime: number;
  correctGuessTime?: number;
  drawingComplexity?: number;
  playerEngagement: Record<string, number>;
}
```
